            <h2 class="name">Angelo Accardi</h2>
            <p class="description">Born in the south of Italy, Angelo Accardi grew up surrounded by both modern and traditional art. Although he studied fine art at the Art Academy of Naples, he never completed his training. Preferring to learn by example and practice, Accardi opened his own studio. Angelo Accardi illustrates surreal visions of everyday life under realistic backdrops of urban and natural landscapes. There is never a single meaning, but a whole story behind each painting. Ironic, striking, and playful, Accardi’s unique perspective and avante garde style is a result of his diverse inspirations.</p>

            <h2 class="name">Ryan Sullivan</h2>
            <p class="description">Sullivan’s paintings reflect his dynamic and constantly-evolving mode of abstraction, with each painting standing as a physical record of its own creation – both embodying and describing material flows and physical processes. Evocative and unrepeatable, Sullivan’s works have been praised for their assertion of painting's enduring critical importance and potential. </p>

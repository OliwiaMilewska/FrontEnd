        <h1>Announcing Our Los Angeles Gallery Spaces Opening 2023</h1>
            <p>
                &emsp;We will open our first gallery spaces in Los Angeles in January 2023, as announced by The New York Times. The gallery currently has locations in New York. Anna Delvey will construct a new gallery from the ground up and will renovate two existing buildings on North Western Avenue, between Melrose Avenue and Clinton Street, in East Hollywood. The newly constructed three-story building, located at 606 North Western Avenue, will open to the public in January 2023 with an exhibition of new work by Njideka Akunyili Crosby. This will be Anna Delvey’s first exhibition with the Los Angeles–based artist, whom the gallery has represented since 2018.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;The new building is being designed by New York-based Selldorf Architects, with a focus on natural light. It will be 15,000 square feet in total, comprising an exhibition space, offices, and private viewing rooms with a dedicated parking area for visitors located at the corner of Clinton Street and North Western Avenue. 
                The two existing one-story adjacent buildings, located at 612 and 616 North Western Avenue, were built in the 1930s and originally operated as Hollywood prop shops. The two structures, which are mostly column-free with high ceilings, will be restored and renovated by Selldorf Architects. These two buildings together cover approximately 10,000 square feet, which will be used primarily for exhibitions and programming. There will also be 3,000 square feet of outdoor space and a garden. Los Angeles–based Twinsteps Architecture is serving as executive architect for the entire project. 
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;All three of these spaces are slated to open together in January 2023, and programming for 612 and 616 North Western Avenue will be announced in the upcoming months. Anna Delvey’s Los Angeles spaces will be co-led by Alexandra Tuttle and Robert Goff. Tuttle joined the gallery in early February as a senior director, and will work with the gallery’s artists and focus on programming. Robert Goff, who has been with the gallery since 2015 and is a senior director, will focus on client development across the West Coast. Goff was based out of Anna Delvey’s New York locations from 2015 to 2019 and relocated to Los Angeles in early 2020.

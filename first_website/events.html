            <p>&emsp;Why kids should draw? Children can't always express themselves using words and actions, so drawing is another important form of communication. You can gain an insight into your child's thoughts and feelings through their drawings. Being able to express what they feel also boosts a child's emotional intelligence. Now in its third year, the Young Artists’ Summer Show is a free, open submission exhibition for students aged 5–19. Artworks are judged by artists and arts professionals with selected artworks displayed online and on-site at the Royal Academy of Arts.<a href="https://form.jotformeu.com/82194815692365" target="blank_">Sign up</a>

            <p>&emsp;Everywhere round the world pottery workshops are considered as a particularly valuable way to spend one’s free time. They make it possible to get away from one’s everyday life, relax and test one’s creative potential. With all the people who look for ideas on how to spend their free time in an interesting way, new challenges, and who want to develop themselves in a creative way in mind, we have prepared a program of pottery workshops adjusted to your availability and expectations. With the help of the four elements: water, fire, air, and earth, you will be able to create your own, unique stoneware vessels.<span>Price:Two-hour workshop – 165 $</span>

            <p>
                &emsp;This is the third talk of the six-part series Colorstruck! Painting, Pigment, Affect, presented by Richard J. Powell of Duke University for the 71st A. W. Mellon Lectures in the Modern Art Gallery. This talk takes part of its title from a painting by the acclaimed Washington, DC, artist Alma Thomas. The source for this titular and material intensity is celestial and joins the chromatic attractions and inflections that also energized countless other artists. Encapsulating this solar affect in the phrase “fire light and heat for the world,” the poet-playwright Amiri Baraka connected Thomas’s luminous palette and the noun and verb “glow” to a modern Black consciousness, and to allusions to human agency, volition, and life’s radiant possibilities. Registration is required.

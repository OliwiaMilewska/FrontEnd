        <h2>New exhibition by Ryan Sullivan</h2>
        <div class="text">
            <a href="article1.html"><img src="pictures/ryan2.png" alt="New exhibition by Ryan Sullivan"></a>
            <p>
                &emsp;Ryan Sullivan’s latest exhibition at Sadie Coles HQ features a sequence of paintings made between 2019 and 2021. In counterpoint to the three-year span of the works on display, each of Sullivan’s paintings is made quickly, in a one-off session. These different levels of duration point to the significance of time as a concept in his paintings, where ideas of permanence and present-tense contingency operate in tandem. In line with earlier works, Sullivan’s paintings were made flat on the floor, using a fast-drying resin mixed with pigment. Each was made ‘in reverse’ by brushing layers of resin into a flat rubber tray. In this regard, the works are similar to paintings on glass, where the final object is a mirror image – a reverse impression – of the process of painting. In Sullivan’s paintings, there is no glass ‘membrane’ between the paint and the viewer – it is as if the paint has been peeled free. And yet the analogy underlines the profound flatness of his works, both physically and temporally. <a href="article1.html">Read more</a>

The exhibition focuses on the continuous progress of Chinese civilization and the historical course of building a multiethnic country. It also illustrates the Chinese people's outstanding achievements and their contributions to human civilization. The exhibition starts 20.05.2022.

        <h2>Monet to Morisot: The Real and Imagined in European Art</h2>
        <div class="text">
            <p>&emsp;Featuring nineteenth- and early twentieth-century artworks from our collection by artists born in Europe or its colonies, Monet to Morisot: The Real and Imagined in European Art focuses on a period of significant societal transformation, when artistic techniques, subject matter, and patronage underwent profound changes. The “real and imagined” throughline of the exhibition offers an evocative and flexible lens through which to consider the artworks across five interrelated themes, unbound by chronology, and to encourage critical questions: What is real and what is imagined in works that assert and reflect views of gender, class, labor, colonialism, and nature? Who produces these frames of reference, and for whom? These questions also remind us that the traditional canon of European art history is both imagined and real. <a href="article3.html">Read more</a>
